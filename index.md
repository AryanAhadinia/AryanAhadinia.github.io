## About Me

I am a master of computer science student at IC, [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I have recently completed a six month internship at [Oracle Labs Switzerland](https://labs.oracle.com/) on LLMs/Agents. I had done a semester research project at [INDY](https://indy.epfl.ch/), EPFL on Bayesian Optimization with [Dr. Anthony Bardou](https://abardou.github.io) and [Prof. Dr. Patrick Thiran](https://people.epfl.ch/patrick.thiran). I also worked on Deep Equilibrium models as student research assistant at EPFL. Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/) and done my thesis on graph mining in social networks under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Maryam Ramezani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cBR8x-4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. Hamid R. Rabiee](https://sharif.edu/~rabiee/).

## Research Interests

In a nutshell, I am interested in **Machine Learning** and **Data Mining**. More specifically:

- **LLMs/Agents**: During my internship at Oracle Labs, I have worked on different aspects of building and using LLMs/Agents with **reasoning** capability.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: As a semester project at EPFL, I have worked on encoding invariance in BO for more efficient BO with lower regret bound (arXiv '25).
- **Graph Mining, Social Networks**: During my bachelors, I have worked on graph mining in the context of social networks. We were particullarly interested in applying **probablistic models** on time-series data to discover hidden spatial and temporal relations in Social Media (TKDD '23, Scientific Reports '24).
